        <h1>Algorithm Overview</h1>
        <p>
          This documentation describes the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in the context of selecting redistrictings.
          Documentation of the underlying data structures of Rakan and how to interact with them can be found on the
          <a href="/documentation/api">API Guide</a> Page. Documentation of term definitions can be found
          <a href="/documentation/">What is gerrymandering?</a> page. It is suggested you read the documentation in
          the order they're listed in the navigation.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 1: Represent Precincts as Graph Nodes</h2>
        <p>
          The first step is to construct a graph, where each node represents a precinct, where an edge is placed
          between two nodes if they're physically bordering each other.
          <br /><br />
          Let the ordered list $g$ represent the graph, where $g_i$ is the $i$th precinct in the graph.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2: Attach Meta Data to Vertexes</h2>
        <p>
          Each node (precinct) has meta data, specifically population and political demographic information. The exact
          details of what's encoded can be found on the <a href="/states/">state data</a> page.
          <br />
          <br />
          Let the ordered list $p$ represent populations, where $p_i$ describes the population of $g_i$. Similarly, let
          $d$ be an ordered list, where $d_i$ notes which district $g_i$ is in.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3: Define Graph Scoring Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          The graph, $g$, - and given the meta data defined in $p$ and $d$ - is now able to be scored. A score is
          defined in such a way to describe the "good"ness of $g$.
        </p>
        <h3>Compactness Score</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to rate a graph with long snaking districts poorly; or create a scoring system that is maximized
          when the area to perimeter ratio is maximized. In $g$, an area of a district is defined by the number of
          nodes it contains. A perimeter, is defined by the number of edges that connect the district and different
          districts.
          <br /><br />
          The compactness score of $g$ should ideally rate district borders with long snaking patterns poorly. Such a
          scoring method could be defined as the <strong>inverse</strong> of:
          <br /><br />
          $$C(g) = \sum^{\text{districts}} {{{\text{perimeter}}^2}\over{\text{area}}}$$
        </p>
        <h3>Population Balance Score</h3>
        <p>
          Population balance scores are measured in standard deviations. Given $g$ and $p$, the standard deviation of
          the total population is the following:
          <br /><br />
          $$\sigma(g)^2 = {1\over{|g| - 1}} \sum_{i = 1}^{|G|} {(p_i - \bar{p})^2}$$
        </p>
        <h3>Combining Scores</h3>
        <p>
          The scoring functions $\sigma$ and $C$ describe "bad"ness of $g$. Thus the lower the score, the better $g$
          is. Additionally, each component of $\text{score}(g)$ is given a weight, notated as $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          $$ \text{score}(g) = \exp{(-(\alpha C(g) + \beta \sigma (g)))}$$
