        <h1>What is Gerrymandering?</h1>
        <p>
          Before we can define what Gerrymandering is, we begin with a crash course in how voting in the
          United States works. The United States is not a democracy; rather it is a Republican Democracy.
          Instead of citizens directly voting on issues, citizens vote on representatives that represent
          their interests in the federal and state government.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the United States’ youth, it was decided that the states split their geography into
          “precincts” (synonymous to “voting district”). Precinct boundaries were drawn such that the voting
          population in each precinct was roughly the same. These precincts were then grouped into
          “districts,” where districts were subjected to similar requirements as precincts, but on a much
          larger scale. Each district had elected individuals that would represent the interests of the area
          in the federal and state government.
        </p>
        <p>
          As early as 1812, it became apparent that by simply changing the boundaries of districts, elected
          officials could maintain their power – even if most voters didn’t vote for them. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see/?utm_term=.00faa9d0f919">Huffington

          Of course, in the real world, precincts are squares and states aren’t rectangles. Obvious
          gerrymandering typically takes the form of strange “spaghetti”-ish figures. Take for instance this
          district in Pennsylvania.

          Unfortunately, gerrymandering is ultimately subjective. The district above could be argued to reach a
          specific demographic; such as fishermen, or certain ethnic groups. This is the inspiration for the Rakan
          project, to mathematically define gerrymandering.
        </p>

        <h2>Assumptions &amp; Definitions</h2>
        <p>
          For Rakan's purposes, for a redistricting to be "legal" it must fulfill the following conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>A district cannot be geographically separated into two parts; all precincts in a district
              must be
              directly bordering another precinct in the same district.</li>
            <li>States with multi-polygonal precincts must be split into sub-precincts. Each sub-precinct
              should be
              considered as a single precinct while Rakan runs.</li>
          </ul>
          Redistrictings that are not meet these conditions are not considered a part of the solution set.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a redistricting to be "good," it must fulfil the following conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>Districts are geographically compact, as in the number of precincts connected that are in
              different
              precincts are minimized.</li>
            <li>Distrits represent the population fairly. For instance, if a state has $n$ districts, each
              state should
              have roughly $\frac{1}{n}$ th of the total population in each district.</li>
          </ul>
          The goal of Rakan isn't to find the optimal solution given these "good" parameters (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/06/03/this-computer-programmer-solved-gerrymandering-in-his-spare-time/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0624df83f70f"
            target="_blank">It's already been "found"</a>). Rather, project Rakan's goal is to determine
          the probability that a given redistricting is gerrymandered.
