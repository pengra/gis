        <h1>What is Gerrymandering?</h1>
        <small>Disclosure: I’m not a lawyer.</small>
        <h2>Precincts &amp; Districts</h2>
        <p>
          Before we can define what gerrymandering is, we begin with a crash course in how voting in the United States
          works. Note that the United States is not a democracy; rather it is a Republican Democracy. Instead of
          citizens directly voting on issues, citizens vote on representatives that represent their interests in the
          federal and state government.
          <br />
          During the United States’ youth, it was decided that the states split their geography into “precincts”
          (synonymous to “voting district”). Precinct boundaries were drawn such that the voting population in each
          precinct was roughly the same. These precincts were then grouped into “districts,” where districts were
          subjected to similar requirements as precincts, but on a much larger scale. Each district had elected
          individuals that would represent the interests of the area in the federal and state government.
          <br />
          For instance, Washington state has around 5,500 precincts, and only 10 congressional districts – and 10
          representatives in Congress.

        <h2>Redistricting</h2>
        <p>
          As states shift in population sizes, states are granted more districts (or lose districts if the population
          shrinks). Additionally, states must balance the populations between districts between growing cities and/or
          growing rural areas. When this occurs, the state is tasked with redrawing district lines. This process is
          known as redistricting.
          <br />
          Redistricting policies vary from state to state. Some states have a non-partisan committee, while other
          states have the ruling party draw district lines (what could go wrong here?). Other states may have other
          policies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Some Legal Redistricting Criteria</h2>
        <p>
          There are currently a few federal redistricting requirements.
          <ol>
            <li>Representatives are to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6357954371173516293"
                target="_blank"></a>“be elected by districts composed of contiguous territory”</a> (and only one
              representative per district)</li>
            <li>Districts are to have <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6357954371173516293" target="_blank">“as
                nearly as practicable an equal number of inhabitants”</a></li>
            <li>Racial and ethnic minorities in states must be able <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/10301"
                target="_blank">“to participate in the political process and to
                elect representatives of their choice.”</a></li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          The last two requirements aren’t hard rules. There have been exceptions to both rules. Typically speaking,
          districts with even a 1% disparity are constitutionally suspicious, and may be rejected by the courts for
          being unconstitutional.
          <br />
          Additionally, if a minority population in a state is naturally diluted, and designing districts to force a
          minority majority in one district is impracticable, the requirement may be dropped.
          <br />

        <h2>Gerrymandering</h2>
        <p>
          As early as 1812, it became apparent that certain redistrictings, ensured elected officials could maintain
          their power – even if most voters didn’t vote for them. The Huffington Post infographic below demonstrates
          how this is possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the infographic portrays, gerrymandering is the act of reducing competitiveness of districts to benefit a
          single party. Blatant gerrymandering is typically easy to spot, for instance, in the years 1993 - 1999, North
          Carolina’s 12th district was a textbook example of gerrymandering.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, gerrymandering is ultimately subjective. The district above could be argued to reach a
          specific demographic; such as fishermen, or certain ethnic groups. This is the inspiration for the Rakan
          project, to mathematically define gerrymandering.
        </p>

        <h2>Rakan's Assumptions &amp; Definitions</h2>
        <p>
          For Rakan's purposes, for a redistricting to be "legal" it must fulfill the following conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>A district cannot be geographically separated into two parts; all precincts in a district
              must be
              directly bordering another precinct in the same district.</li>
            <li>States with multi-polygonal precincts must be split into sub-precincts. Each sub-precinct
              should be
              considered as a single precinct while Rakan runs.</li>
          </ul>
          Redistrictings that are not meet these conditions are not considered a part of the solution set.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a redistricting to be "good," it must fulfil the following conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>Districts are geographically compact, as in the number of precincts connected that are in
              different
              precincts are minimized.</li>
            <li>Distrits represent the population fairly. For instance, if a state has $n$ districts, each
              state should
              have roughly $\frac{1}{n}$ th of the total population in each district.</li>
          </ul>
          The goal of Rakan isn't to find the optimal solution given these "good" parameters (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/06/03/this-computer-programmer-solved-gerrymandering-in-his-spare-time/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0624df83f70f"
            target="_blank">It's already been "found"</a>). Rather, Rakan hopes to be able to determine the probability
          of a redistricting being gerrymandered. This is achieved by comparing a redistricting in question to other
          possible redistrictings and measuring how it performs in a handful of metrics defined by legal requirements
          and by user defined metric requirements.
